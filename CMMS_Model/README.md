To provide visibility into line-level maintenance events, allowing stakeholders to track downtime, frequency of issues, and preventive vs corrective maintenance trends.

## ðŸ“Š Tools Used
- Power BI Desktop
- Power Query (ETL steps)
- DAX Measures
- Dimensional Modeling (Star Schema)

**Dimensions**
- DimLine: Line number and description
- DimDepartment: Department associated with the line
- DimDate: Shared date table
